# Beginning ArcGIS for Desktop using .NET (C# and VB and ArcObjects)

This is a repo for the source code files of the book Beginning ArcGIS for Desktop Development Using .NET (by Pouria Amirian)! 

The source code for the examples that appear in the book (and even more for chapter 13) are organized by chapter, with all the files for the examples from each chapter in a separate folder. 

Within each of the folders, youâ€™ll find a set of zipped files along with other necessary files that correspond to many of the Try It Out exercises. 

It is recommended that you walk through the exercises from start to finish and use the code samples as a simple guideline where needed. 

In order to run the code samples you need to perform the following in Visual Studio (after unzipping each zip file): 

1.Check the version of ArcGIS in the configuration file for Desktop Add-Ins (Config.esriaddinx file)

2.Check/set the installation path of ArcMap (or ArcCatalog) in Debug tab of project properties (for both Desktop Add-ins and Extending ArcObjects project)

3.Check/set the Esri References

You can find step by step instruction in readme.pdf file.

Good luck with your ArcObjects projects!

Regards,
Pouria
